  I'm Ellie Perkins Petit-Blanc from Grand Canyon, AZ. I am graduating in Biostatistics from Brigham Young University- Idaho in December 2021. I am in love with statistics and DNA, so this field is my dream come true. This particular project was inspired by a bioinformatics class I took at BYU-Idaho where we studied 4 autoimmune diseases and found similarities between them.
